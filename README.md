### About The Project

> **Swasthya AI** is a revolutionary health-tech platform designed to tackle Nepal's most critical healthcare challenges. Our mission is to democratize access to quality medical diagnostics and care by empowering clinicians with state-of-the-art AI tools.

Nepal's healthcare landscape faces significant hurdles: a strained doctor-patient ratio, geographic barriers isolating remote communities, and diagnostic delays that impact patient outcomes. We built Swasthya AI to be the solution.

This platform integrates AI-assisted diagnostics, predictive health analytics, and a seamless telemedicine service to bring world-class healthcare to every corner of the nation, from bustling urban centers like Kathmandu to the most remote villages.
